<h1 align="center">Open Web Desktop</h1>
<h3 align="center">
  A framework for building web-based desktop experiences.
</h3>

## Overview
Open Web Desktop (OWD) is a framework designed to provide a simple environment for building web-based desktop experiences. It's built with Vue.js & TypeScript, and it leverages the extensible Nuxt.js architecture.

[Check out the demo](https://owdproject.github.io/docs) of the `client` base repository, decked with a couple of modules.

## Features
- Open-source web desktop environment built with Nuxt.js
- Fully extendable through themes, apps, and modules
- Bundled with popular libraries like Pinia, VueUse, Mitt
- Designed to make the most of the Nuxt.js ecosystem
- Styled with PrimeVue and Tailwind for a consistent UI
- Fully localizable with i18n support

## Getting started
Required software:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org)

When you are ready, bootstrap a new project by running:
```bash
npm create owd
```
Once the process is complete, you can start to develop:
```bash
# Run the dev server with hot-reload
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run generate
```

## Modules
Open Web Desktop projects can be extended with themes, plugins, and desktop apps â€” whether contributed by the community or created custom for your needs. Explore available modules at [topics/owd-modules](https://github.com/topics/owd-modules).

### Install a new app
You can simply install a new app with `npm install @owdproject/app-todo` or by cloning it into `./desktop/apps/app-todo`. Then, define the application in your project configuration.

```typescript
// owd.config.ts
export default defineDesktopConfig({
    apps: [
        "@owdproject/app-about",
        "@owdproject/app-todo",
    ]
})
```

## Themes
Themes allow you to customize the look and feel of your Open Web Desktop instance.
You can explore available themes, ranging from popular OS designs to fully custom creations, at [topics/owd-themes](https://github.com/topics/owd-themes).

### Install a new theme
You can install a new theme by defining it as a Nuxt.js layer in `nuxt.config.ts`.  
Themes can be loaded from a local path or directly from a GitHub repository.

**1. Using a local theme:**

Clone it first in a folder of your project like `./desktop/theme/theme-win95`.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:owdproject/theme-win95.git ./desktop/theme/theme-win95
```

Then specify the path theme in the `nuxt.config.ts` configuration:

```typescript
// nuxt.config.ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
    modules: [
        "@owdproject/core",
    ],

    extends: [
        "./desktop/theme/theme-win95"
    ],
    
    ...
```

**2. Using a theme from GitHub:**

To use a theme directly specifying  a GitHub repository, use this format: `github:<username>/<repository>`:

```typescript
// nuxt.config.ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
    modules: [
        "@owdproject/core",
    ],

    extends: [
        "github:owdproject/theme-gnome",
        { install: true }
    ],
    
    ...
```

## Contributing

**Any contribution is welcome!** Open Web Desktop is built with Nuxt and follows a modular architecture, making it easy to contribute to the core codebase or create new modules, themes and desktop apps.

### Local Development Setup

If you'd like to contribute, here's how to set up your local development environment:

**Prerequisites:**

- [Git](https://git-scm.com)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org)

**Cloning the Repository:**

To contribute, start by forking the Open Web Desktop client repository on GitHub.  
Then, clone your fork using HTTPS or SSH:

```bash
# Clone using HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/client.git

# Clone using SSH
git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/client.git
```

Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the project folder.  
Install the dependencies, then start the development server:

```bash
cd owd-client

npm install
npm run dev
```

This will launch Open Web Desktop in development mode, allowing you to test your changes and see them reflected in real-time.
The dev server will be available at http://localhost:3000 by default.
